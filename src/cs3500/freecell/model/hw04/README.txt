/*
 - Created an abstract class and lifted common fields and common methods between the
 simplefreecell model and the multimovefreecell model (only difference is how each model
 implements the move method).
 - Changed the fields in the abstract class to protected.
 - Changed some helpers in the abstract freecell model class to be protected so that both
 implementations can use them.
 - Created an abstract testing class to reuse tests for both implementations.
 - Created two testing classes, one for each freecell model implementation to extend the abstract
 class.
